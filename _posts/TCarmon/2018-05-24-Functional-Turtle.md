I thought this function exercise was going to be easy after struggling with the functions exercises...NOT! I'm finding that I know what I want to do however, figuring out how to do it in Python still takes me a good deal of time. 

My refactored turtle was inspired by the "Functional Turtles Exercise" assignment. The assignment page gave an example of a function created to handle repeat circles. A light bulb instanly went on for me because I remembered copying and pasting when creating a turtle with repeat circles. Anyway, here's my refactored turtle:

And here's my original turtle:

I am open to suggestions and ideas!
