Here's my list of project milestones:

- [ ] Set-up dictionary (or list) 
- [ ] Set up function to deal cards
- [ ] Set-up calculations to determine total sum for dealer and player hand
- [ ] Handle user input- ask if they want another card, hit/stay, ask user if they want to play again?
- [ ] Create loops to handle dealing more cards
- [ ] Create  “congratulations” or “dealer wins” type of feedback for user

Wish me luck!
