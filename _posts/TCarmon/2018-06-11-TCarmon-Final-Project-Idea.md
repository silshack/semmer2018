title: "Tia's final project idea"
---

My project idea is to create a data analysis tool that will allow users to select the data file they want to work with, and also select what data they want to see in order to visualize the data in a histogram (as suggested on the assignment page). My idea needs to be fleshed out much more. I will work on that tonight so that I can get a start on implementing my final project.

I am thinking that I will need to find a way to allow the user to select the fields, this way the tool could be used with various csv files, not just the file used to create the data analysis tool. Stretch goals would be to display the data in a graph of some sort.

**Final project milestones**
-	[ ] Allow user to select the file they want to work with
-	[ ] Allow user to input what fields in the csv file they want to visualize
-	[ ] Display the user output
-	[ ] Present help text if users writes “help”
