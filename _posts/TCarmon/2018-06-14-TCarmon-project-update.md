June 14th project update
I have experienced some anxiety and panic while working on my final project the past couple of days. I was able to find a data set, refine the data set (needed to cut off some rows and columns from the original), insert my data set to my Trinket, develop my thoughts of how I would utilize the “main menu” starter code found in Tuesday’s class notes.

One of the road blocks that I have experienced is deciding how to visualize my data. I decided to start with a question that I could try to answer with the data thinking maybe this would help me think of ideas. I do not want to just randomly do something because I know how to do it. So, I think my struggle is finding ways to put everything together.

**Revised final project milestones**
-	[x] Allow user to select the file they want to work with
-	[ ] Allow user to input what fields in the csv file they want to visualize
-	[ ] Display the user output
-	[ ] ~~Present help text if users writes “help”~~ Present help text if user selects “Help” from the main menu

**Here's my Trinket with my work as it is now:**
