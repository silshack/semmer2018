# Classes

Classes are recipes for making objects.  They allow you to use familiar notation to define methods, similar to functions, and attributes, similar to variables.

Here's an example you'll see in your reading:

You can also base classes on preexisting ones.  This is called **class extension**.  Here's an example of how to make a `BoxTurtle` class, which is a turtle but different in key ways we specify.

For homework, I want you to use this new knowledge to improve an existing trinket, both by refactoring it and by adding some new feature using the abilities of classes.
