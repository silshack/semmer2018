What I was trying to do here is to create a formula for BMI. It took me for a while to get the formula right. First, I forgot 
to put `float()` when creating the BMI formula. But after the creation of formula, I felt like it's not difficult to draw 
the conditional cookies by using `if()` , `elif()`, and `else()`. I also used `try:` and `except:` to make sure the user types
an integer. All in all, my logical turtle practic was not that hard to complete.
