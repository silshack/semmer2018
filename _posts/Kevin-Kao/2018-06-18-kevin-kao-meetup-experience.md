My first Meetup experience on June 13 was a great one. The meetup I attended was called TriPython (Triangle Python Users Group),
which is a monthly event in Raleigh, Chapel Hill and Durham. This time is in Chapel Hill. It’s actually a small group and 
there were only 6 people attending this project night. So we got to know each other very soon at the beginning of the event. 
Aravind and Martin were also in this meetup. 

Apart from us, there were two guys and the host. Chris was the host and also the organizer. In the beginning, 
he briefly introduced the Tripython and how it works. 

One of other two attendees called John is interested in making the audio data analysis by applying deep learning and 
machine learning. Deep learning and machine learning are the common terms that I usually heard of.  However, he told us he’s 
also the beginner of Python so that’s why he was here to exchange ideas. He shared some of his code regarding using data 
to make a real sound of gunshot. He also shared some of his finished work with us. However, I could not even distinguish 
the difference between two sounds. He told us that one sound came from different sources of data which were combined. 
There was only slight difference between each of the two. I can tell that John is a professional in this field and pays much 
attention on what he loves. 

The other interesting thing was that he used Juputer notebook to write python code. He also showed us how to install Jupyter 
Notebook via Anaconda. The user interface of Jupyter Notebook looks nice as well and it’s very easy to install. 
I think I will try to use Jupyter Notebook to write Python code in the future. 

All in all, it was a great experience for this meetup. I got the chance to meet some professional people in the coding field. 
Although I am a beginner in the coding field and might not be able to understand some of the terms, I feel like it’s a 
good opportunity for me to reach out to people and learn their experience.
