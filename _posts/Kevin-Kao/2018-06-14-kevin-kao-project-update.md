I was trying to use pandas package to make the data frame for the two csv files. Looking at my two csv files, 
I found out that there are quite a few “no data” in the files. I think I have to either clean them up or extract only useful 
data from those two files. Then I will have a tidy data frame to make the graphs.

I feel like the most challenging part is to organize the datasets. I’ve been thinking how to do it for a while. 
Here is my embedded code so far:

I heard someone in the meetup saying that pandas package is really powerful when it comes to make the data frame. 
Therefore, I spent some time doing research on pandas and found out that it’s a useful package. So I’ve decided to use pandas 
to organize my own data. I think the most challenging part is that I am going to learn many new things in a short period of time.
But since it’s helpful and I am interested in data analysis, I have to make more efforts on this. 

**milestones**

- [ ] Create main menu for the user to choose to see either unemployment rate or GDP per capita or both
- [ ] The user can choose the specific country 
- [ ] Show the specific country’s unemployment rate or GDP per capita or both in the line graph (matplotlib)
- [ ] The user can choose to see the countries’ color depth which depends on unemployment rate or GDP per capita in the world map. (paygal)


* Are there any roadblocks ahead? Is there anything your group can do to help out?
I think the organizing the data is most difficult part. I’ve spent much testing the data by using pandas. 
But I’m still not sure how to make a plot. 

* Are your milestones ambitious enough? Make sure to include some stretch goals.
I want to make the user clearly understand (1) the changes in unemployment rate and gdp per capita in the past 10 years by using the matplotlib plot. 
(2) the comparison of different countries in terms of unemployment rate and gdp per capita in 2017 showing in the world map.

* Are your milestones too ambitious? Make sure to break down the unglamorous parts of coding into chunks that reflect the actual work to be done.
I think it’s executable. 

* Are you able to keep to your plan? Looking back at what you’ve actually done, is the difference accountable to bad planning (i.e. not anticipating what needed to be done), bad execution (not doing it), or something else?
I think I will stick to my plans and execute them step by step. I hope I can make it in the end.
