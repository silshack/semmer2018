I’m quite interested in global economy and curious about the Gross Domestic Product comparison among different countries. 
Therefore, I’m thinking to create a program where the user can look up the GDP per capita and unemployment for every country. 
The user can also choose to see the top ten countries with highest GDP per capita or with the lowest unemployment rate.

I will also make the graph for showing how the GDP per capita and unemployment rate vary in the last ten years. 
The user can select any country to see the graph so as to learn the relationship between GDP per capita and unemployment rate. 
The user can also select several countries to compare their GDP per capita or unemployment rate and then 
the program will display that graph as well. 

I think I will draw related data from the International Monetary Fund website.
