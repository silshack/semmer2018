title: "Scylarmartin's meetup reflection"

I went to one of the meeting of tripython last Wednesday. It is more like a problemshooting night that does not have a specific topic
compared to the other meetup I heard of. I was really nervous before I came to the event. I was worried about what if I cannot follow the
topic or have a hard time to make the conversation. Well, to be honest, the reality is a little bit disapponting since there are only six
people attended the event including the host. And since there is no leading topic that I can learn, there is not much "tech" gain. However,
this event still shows me the big picture of what coding community looks like. The host introduced their organization and events they host.
I learned there are plenty of event in various level I can attend. This is way more clear than the calendar on the website. In addition, 
meeting other people is beneficial, too. This is my first time contact with community and I think I gain a better understanding of the diversity
talk we did before. One of the people coming, named John, has a background of biology, just like me. And now he is working as a data scientist,
developing his own app. Attending a meetup make me realize that there are unlimited chance to communicate, exchange thought, sharing idea
with all kind of people who have the similiar goal or enthusiasm.
