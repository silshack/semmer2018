Here is my old milestone for the final project.

1. Figure out how the turtle can chase each other.(If I cant realize that, I can always add multiple turtle moving randomly, and if my
turtle's distance to them is smaller than a certain pixel, I lose.)
2. List all the featured element(bomb,treat..) I want to add.
+
+3. Figure out how to define a screen with more detail and build it with an appropriate background picture.
+
+4. Design the users interface that could let player to play again and custom the game.

I decide to move the #4 to the top of list. I ll list what I want customer to interact with the game. In current stage, I did not actually
start the coding yet. But I already collect most of the functions and feaure I will apply in this project and figured out what method I ll 
use to build the element. I decided to custom box and other element to form the maze, obstables, treat and punishment in the game. And I 
will apply the idea in the turtle video to set my screen ordinate as (0,0,1000,1000) for a easy postive number design. In addition, I am be
ablt to build the chasing turtle now. Therefore, I will cancel the backup plan(random moving turtle) or I can turn them into a random moving
treat.

Here is my new milestone:

1. Design the customer interface, to let them to choose the different scenario, different difficulty,play again, see therir current turtle 
status, current score or restart.

2. Figure out how to make the box and other element random display in each new game.

3. Decide what the density of each element for each level of difficulties.

4. Decide mode of chase and player turtle.

5. ****Test what parameter is most suitable for each part( the speed of player turtle, how chase turtle move, how hard is the punishment).
  
  
The last milestone can be divided into several small milestone when I finish the basic coding and will be super time-consuming. I think I need
to start the last step no later than Sunday night.

And here is a draft of my collect of the code I need.
