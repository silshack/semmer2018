This project is not as hard as I thought when I watched the Chapter 2 video since a lot of code and functions are already available in
the exercise and ready for remixed. However, it stills take me a while to figure out how to realize the function of that 5 pixel problem 
and how the while loop works. I am confused about when to state a condition is true or false. But I make it work when I test the code.
I use the background color and word as a hint for the users. It takes 2-3 times to adjust the appropriate range of background color change.
In addtion, there are tons of mistakes when I code. I forgot all the colon after the "elif" in the beginning and missed some quotation 
marks too.
Here is my link of my project:

I did not apply the turtle write function and didnt set my own screen size. Maybe thats something I can add in. Also, it is good idead to 
add keyon function in if there is a maze instead of blank screen. But I didnot know how to define or make a maze yet.
