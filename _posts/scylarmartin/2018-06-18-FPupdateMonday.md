Here is my old milestone:
1. Design the customer interface, to let them to choose the different scenario, different difficulty,play again, see therir current turtle 
+status, current score or restart.
+
+2. Figure out how to make the box and other element random display in each new game.
+
+3. Decide what the density of each element for each level of difficulties.
+
+4. Decide mode of chase and player turtle.
+
+5. ****Test what parameter is most suitable for each part( the speed of player turtle, how chase turtle move, how hard is the punishment).

I have been experiencing a very hard time when I diggin into the project. There are a lot of thought won't work or much more complicated
than I thought. I haven't complete my code yet since I have to go over the basic concept, especially Class all over again. It is definitely
harder than I thought when I try to define a method in a specific class.
For the user's interface, I complete the game status part. I build a counter which allow the user to track their score. I haven't cover 
the changing level and replay since I havent complete the main loop yet.
I spend a lot of time on how set the map and what kind of way I want the player and enemy turtle to run. Right now I make the player turtle
to move forward or backward automatically and user can adjust the orientation. And I give the idea of chasing turtle up since the chasing
turtle is chasing the player based on the angle. In my maze, they will block or bounce out by the wall. It makes more sense to add multiple 
random moving turtle. I also figure out it how to build the treasure turtle.

Here is my new milestone:
1.Finish the setting of wall
2.Complete the function of the enemy turtle.
3.Differentiate the level by adjust the speed of enemy turtle.
4.set the punishment as awake the collected treasure
5.Finish the main loop and test the interface

Here's my current work:
