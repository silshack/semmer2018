Final Project:
For the final project, I would like to focus on the turtle game. I think that making a interesting game is kind of rewarding and I always 
wondered that how hard it could be to make a game myself. I am thinking about building a turtle chasing game. One turtle will chase the 
one played by users. Player needs to collect visible and invisible beans to win. When you collect enough beans and did not catch by the
turtle, you win.
In addition, there is a lot of detail I can add into the game. For example, I can add random treate and bomb, and some featured tool can 
give extra life or accelerate your speed or block the enemy turtle from moving for certain time. These treats could be random and appear in
certain period of time. I will also include the custom detail:user can name and custom the turtle they want and choose the diffculty they 
want to take.(Such as different speed of turtle and different density of bomb and treat). In this scenario, I think keyboard direction is 
much better than the clicky feature, but I will try to add the click event if it's possible.
Here's a simple list of final project milestone:

1. Figure out how the turtle can chase each other.(If I cant realize that, I can always add multiple turtle moving randomly, and if my 
turtle's distance to them is smaller than a certain pixel, I lose.)

2. List all the featured element(bomb,treat..) I want to add.

3. Figure out how to define a screen with more detail and build it with an appropriate background picture.

4. Design the users interface that could let player to play again and custom the game.
