Dictionary is kind of hard for me. I think I need more practice for it. The tricky part is that the logic of dict coding and solution for
the inconsistency(such as sorted the United States first) is much more complicated than before. I can copmplete it with the step-by-step 
hint for now. But if there is no clue, I doubt I can figure it out all by myself. I will practice more on the dict topic
