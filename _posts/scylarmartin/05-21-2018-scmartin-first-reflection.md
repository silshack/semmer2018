This is my first reflection. I just completed the assignment this week. I feel the coding by myself is totally different from reading them.
I have no difficulty to read the class material, even I struggled a littel in the "input" section. There are a lot of conception covered in
the articles, but they are not hard to undertand. However, coding is very different. I got stucked a long time on the first problem. I have 
no idea how to include the order "enter your name" in my coding. I googled it and find something called "raw input" on python 2 that helps. But
then I learned that it is the "input" in python 3, the one introduced in the chapter 2. Then my coding is stucked on showing the "enter my
name", but not the result in the right column. It takes me a whilt to realized that the right column is where I interact with the my code,
where to input the name in. The second problem is smooth until I have difficulty to calulate the pay since I did not define the hour and rate
as "float". Defining varaibles is in the very first section. I think I need to review the material often. The third problem is easier since 
I learned a lot from previous two problems. The only problem I have is that I cannot type the "converted faranheit tem is "farenheit"" right,
so I typed two print order to print the description and variables. I did not know why it did not work. But I will figure it out. The codind
similiar to a real language, we need to practice as much as we can to be famaliar with them.
