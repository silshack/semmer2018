Here comes my turtlehacks, the project is much more time-consuming than I thought. My original idea is to create a scenario that multiple 
turtles chasing each other, along with the change of turtlr color, moving direction, and background color. But I encounter some difficulty 
on set the speed within a fixed trail and cannot control all the turtle in the same time when they make a turn. Thus I change to project
to make five turtle in a running race.  I add the function feature that learned in the function chapter with the random module. The manual
is kind of hard to understand for me. I am enlighted by this link a lot.:+<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python/9339862606" width
