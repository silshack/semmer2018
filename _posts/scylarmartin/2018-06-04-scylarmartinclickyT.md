I am kind of confused about the set up function in this assignment. Why would we use the setup function to set the screen. I did not see
the difference there. I spend some time to review the previous video and struggled on how to make a helper function. In my understanding,
the helper function is just the self defined function. And what helper fucntions do is to gather the complicated self-defined function 
together and put them in a new tab. That will make the main code section more readable. But I encoutner some difficulty there since I have
to define the screen and turtle all over again, even though author does not did that in the example helper code. If I did not do that and 
only define everything in my main tab, the code just shows the error. In addition, I successfully change the background color when clicking
different area in my screen as I set and also make the screen listen to the keyboard command. However, the turtle won't move followingt the
click, I did not figure it out why this happened. I think it may related the wrong set up in the helper tab.

Here's my clicky turtle:
