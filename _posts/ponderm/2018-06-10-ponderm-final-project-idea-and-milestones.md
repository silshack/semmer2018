# Final Project Idea

Much of what we have done up to this point in class is learn the basics of Python using Turtle and files dealing with data such as email correspondences and financial statements. Now is the perfect time for me to try and incorporate my future career interests and practice using Python in such a way that is directly applicable to how I could potentially utilize Python in the workforce. 

I am particularly interested in infectious diseases and disease surveillance. Currently, I am interested in the general field and do not have a specific disease that I find most interesting. For that reason, I will analyze data concerning the list of notifiable diseases as defined by the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System of the CDC. The [CDC provides access to data](https://wonder.cdc.gov/nndss/nndss_annual_tables_menu.asp) of United States reported cases of these notifiable cases in2016. For the purpose of this project, I will consider data for reported cases and the rate of cases in the entire population,  during specific months of the year, and based on differences between racial groups.

# Milestones

What will my program be able to do?
- [] The user will be able to ask for the rate or number of cases for a specific notifiable disease
- [] The user will be able to ask for help and receive instructions on how to use certain features of the program
- [] The program will display charts for the rate of cases and number of reported cases for diseases for the year of 2016 and also broken down by month and racial group 
- [] The user will be able to identify the diseases with the highest reported cases and rates, as well as the diseases that had none or very few reported cases in 2016
- [] If time permits, the program may provide the user with an external link on the disease or a short blurb about the disease (this may be a bit ambitious, but definitely useful)
