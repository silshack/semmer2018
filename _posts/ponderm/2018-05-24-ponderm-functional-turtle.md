## Reflection

All in all, this program didn't have many repetitive parts to it, but there were plenty of places where the code was cleaned up by having functions replace it. I can definitely see how functions make reading code much easier. If you understand how the code for a function works and can apply it, then doing more extensive coding takes less time and is easier to read.
