# App Milestones for a Black Jack Game

While going over this with my partners in class, we discussed a lot about how to make the app do things like make Ace have a value of 1 or 11 and how to set up the dealer's hand so that it also loops similarly to the player. We then realized that we first are going to try to make a very simplified version of the game with just a random integer 1-10. We also are not going to worry about removing cards from the deck for this version of the game. Although learning that is a relief, I still look forward to potentially doing the advanced version of the game as well. I think this assignment will be a lot of fun working with. For me, it also feels a lot more concrete and I can clearly visualize how I will structure the program as opposed to other assignments where I will sometimes start without a true framework in mind. 

Milestones for basic version of blackjack game:
- [ ] The deck of cards is in the form of a list of values 1 through 10.
- [ ] The cards can be "dealt" for the dealer and the player and values stored. 
- [ ] The player is informed of their current hand and the dealer's final hand score is stored, hidden from the player.
- [ ] A loop is initiated when the player chooses to get more cards and the loop ends when they say they no longer want cards.
- [ ] When the loop ends, the program reveals the winner when the player says they no longer want cards.
