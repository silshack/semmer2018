## Project Updata and Revised Plan

I am sticking with my source as .csv files for archival collections. I am very familiar with these three files because they are all projects that I have processed and uploaded..

Here is an embed of my program so far, V1.1

The idea for the functions of my program however has shifted slightly, below are the four original milestones the first of which I completed.

- [x] Import three .csv files that correspond to finding aids that I've created
- [ ] Write code that will detect data that causes errors "~,%,&,*, etc."
- [ ] User ability to probe data in .csv files
- [ ] Graphical display of number of times a given term appears in a .csv

Now that I have had some time to think about what I want my program to do I am going to breack down the milestones like this

- [x] Import three .csv files that correspond to finding aids that I've created
- [ ] Detect data that causes errors "~,%,&,*, etc."
- [ ] User can discover how many series are in a collection
- [ ] User can ask how many items are in a series
- [ ] User can search collections for specific terms

Since last time I have imported the three .csv files I intend to use and created the basic interface. The biggest roadblocks ahead are actually writing the code for the three functions I intend to include. I think that breaking the assignment down in this way will allow me to think of the program as three discrete parts each satisfying different parts of the requirement for the whole. I hope to be able to complete all three, but the last function may be a little bit of a strech if I want to include graphical display of term frequencies in collection. I perhaps instead should create a graphical display of the number of items in each series in a collection.
