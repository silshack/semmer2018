# Project Idea - Finding Aid Query Program - FAQ Program

My idea for a project is a program that allows the user to get information about a .csv file that corresponds to an archival collection. I work in an archive where I regularly use google sheets to create .csv files and use another program to import them into ArchivesSpace so they can be hosted on our website. I thought that it might be useful to have a program that can (1) Discover common errors that will prevent the .csv from being uploaded and (2) Allow the user to write simple queries to know more about elements of the finding aid.

Here is a duplicate of what I have so far, it's not much other than creating the three modules and setting up the user prompt.

I think that having a practical program as my endgoal will allow me to develop meaningful milestones that will push me to learn more about python. Here are the milestones I have developed thusfar, but I expect them to change as I actually sit down and begin to code.

- [ ] Import three .csv files that correspond to finding aids that I've created
- [ ] Write code that will detect data that causes errors "~,%,&,*, etc."
- [ ] User ability to probe data in .csv files
- [ ] Graphical display of number of times a given term appears in a .csv
