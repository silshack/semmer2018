For reflection purposes I'd like to go through my process for problem solving the Clicky Turtle exercise real time.

When I began I copied code directly over from the Clicky Turtles Exercise webpage into a new trinket. Unfortunately I got an error because I named the second module "animations" not "animations.py"

I returned to the page and remixed the existing turtled, then followed a link to My Trinkets, which was much simpler. I renamed it Clicky Turtle Start.

I began to edit the text of the animation at first to ensure I understood how it factored into the flow of control. I got an Attribute error when I attempted to add more lines of dialog.

I realized that it was because I did "sally.sleep(3)" rather than "time.sleep()"

I changed to colors and the placement of the text to be more to my liking. I went to input actual numbers in the place of 'turn amount' and 'move amount' not realizing that they were defined variables.

Playing on the dialog I entered I inverted Tina's movements. Then I decided to return to the steup animation to set the scene in a bar. I renamed the trinket The Clicky Turtle Bar

I was trying to draw a bar on the botton of the screen and having a real difficult time of it, so I decided to open back up my Turtles Basic Remix. While I used the directional commands it was still helpful to see the fill function again.

I made a bar and I thought I'd make a function to repeatedly make barstools. I had problems because I was writing directly into the startup animation so I cut it out and tried to paste it into the main tab.

Ho boy did I multiply my problems. I had to rename sally tina every time. I had to use tina.hideturtle().

I decided to try to use the circle drawing code from the "Teaching with Turtle" and it broke another part of the code. At this point I'm getting fed up. I can't seem to make any progress because as soon as I 'fix' one thing, it breaks three other things in other parts of the code.

I tried to use the shift + tab hotkey to fix the make_barstool function, but it still gives me an error for the clicky function. I deleted enough code to make it run again.

After finally setting the scene of the bar and making it look like a sick turtle is stumbling about I wanted to fufill the requirements of the lesson.

I'm going to try to use the position function to make things happen in certain areas. I need to look at the documentation more in order to understand the position function.

Overall I feel that this course is overwhelming and frustrating. But I hope that if I can work through these feelings I can get a good basis for increasing my computer literacy.
This course has given me reason to reflect on my personal goals related to my ignorance of computers, programming and software. I want to know more about blockchain technology, encryption, and electronic records. This class hopfully will give me a good vocabulary and a set of some basic skills I can use to develop greater knowledge on these subjects.
