For this assignment I decided to take a trinket that I made called "Remote Controlled Turtle"

Here is the first draft of my trinket,

I was having difficulty getting the turtle colors to change, and I wanted to make the circle drawing a little more seamless. It also seemed that the self.penup function was not executing properly.

I fixed the penup issue, and I was going to edit some of the numbers and directions to get the array to scramble, but I discovered that it was very easy to get the array to scramble through input alone. Here is what the second iteration looks like,

I am still working on figuring out the tracer function, and understanding class extension bettter. and for the life of me I can't figure out why even when I make color an argument I can't get the color of the other turtles to change.
