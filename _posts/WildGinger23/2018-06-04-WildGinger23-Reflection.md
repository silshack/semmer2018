I wrote a small reflection at the end of the post for “The Clicky Turtle Bar”. I said,

“Overall I feel that this course is overwhelming and frustrating. But I hope that if I can work through these feelings I can get a good basis for increasing my computer literacy. This course has given me reason to reflect on my personal goals related to my ignorance of computers, programming and software. I want to know more about blockchain technology, encryption, and electronic records. This class hopfully will give me a good vocabulary and a set of some basic skills I can use to develop greater knowledge on these subjects.”

I am hopeful that I can really engage in some of these upcoming projects.
