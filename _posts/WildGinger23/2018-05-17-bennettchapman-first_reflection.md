## __**Bennett's First Reflection**__

I think that learning python is a lot like learning a foreign language. Like all learning, it involves departing from your comfort zone. More importantly though I think that the principle of "Use it or lose it" applies.

I was enrolled in this class for a few weeks last summer, and thought that jumping back into it would be easy. However although the vocabulary and many of the concepts seem familiar, when it comes to actually writing code I am back at square one.

The three Chapter 2 Variables exercises were actually more challenging for me than before, and I have some questions about input values and types of values.
