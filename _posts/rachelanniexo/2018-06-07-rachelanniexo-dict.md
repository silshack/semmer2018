If I'm being honest, this moved way too fast for me, but I'm glad I was able to get the code in class and figure out what it does rather than trying to build it on my own. May favorite thing about this was being able to iterate through the lines and dictionaries to count, etc rather than having to set up an extraneous counter variable. That ws super cool!
