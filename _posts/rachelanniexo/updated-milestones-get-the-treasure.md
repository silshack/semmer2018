title: "Updated Final Milestones"
---

Howdy hey! These are my updated milestones for my final. Unfortunately I haven't had as much time to work as it as I would've liked because work and some appointments, but I have gotten started.

**My goal is to:**
[] finish the narratorial stuff by Friday
[] make sure I can get from one level to the next over Friday/Saturday
[] flesh out the levels before class on Monday
[] fine tune until the final

**So anyway, these are my new milestones and other things I've been thinking about**
  
Dictionary uses:
[] The user has three lives, keep track of those
[] Find more things to store in the dictionary, maybe?
  
  
**Milestone 1: Level 1**
[x] Make a story line that appears and disappears. 
[] Make a screen that changes colors to mimic a sunset. (Done in python)
[] Make a moon that appears when the screen is black
[] Listen for user interaction to end the level
  
**Milestone 2: Level 2**
[] Make a storyline that appears and disappears.
[] Make a screen that looks like a shattered ceiling window. (Purely visual, Done in Canva)
[] Make a rope on your screen, make it two pixels wider than the character
[] Listen for user interaction
[] If the character touches the edge of the rope, they lose a life
  
**Milestone 3: Connect levels 1 and two**
[] Need more info to determine how this works
[] This is a big milestone, do NOT put it off for last
  
**Milestone 4: Level 3**
[] Make a storyline that appears and disappears.
[] Make a screen that looks like an empty room. (Purely visual, Done in Canva)
  Make set number of laser turtles that come towards character turtle
  Make character have set jumping and landing abilities.
  If the laser turtle hits you, you lose a life
  If the lazer turtles dont hit you, you win the level
  Listen for user interaction

**Milestone 5: Level 4**
[] Make a story line that appears and disappears.
[] Make a grid with hidden bombs
[] Make your character move the size of ech grid
[] Make your character move by click, to opposite -x,-y values
[] Listen for user interacton

**Milestone 6: Level 5**
[] Make a story line that appears and disappears.
[] Make a keyhole 
[] Make a keyturtle that quickly descends from the ceiling
[] If the user presses a key when the keyturtle lines up with the keyhole, they win
[] Listen for user interaction

**Milestone: win and lose screens**
[] All you have to do is make screens

**Options for improvement**
[] Level 3: consider making the user have to clear the screen, jumping up and over rather than just up
[] Level 4: consider uploading an image of 

**Backup:**
I added this because Martin had a backup plan as well and I thought that was very insightful. Basically, I know exactly how I'm going to make levels 3 and 4 work, so I could always make the game consist of these levels in at least three varying levels of difficulty.

And here's my code so far:
