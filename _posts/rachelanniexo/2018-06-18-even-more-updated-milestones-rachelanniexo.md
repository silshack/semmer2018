7. [] Make win screen
8. [] Make lose screen
9. [] Make help screen

**Are there any roadblocks ahead? Is there anything your group can do to help out?**
I don't think there are any road blocks ahead, but I am worried about two things... 
1. How do I get these if statements up and running?
2. What the heck is going to go in my external data file?!

**Are your milestones ambitious enough? Make sure to include some stretch goals.**
I definitely think what I have left to do is plenty, considering the time we have left. If I were to add one extra feature, it would be custom characters to chose from.

**Are you able to keep to your plan? Looking back at what you’ve actually done, is the difference accountable to bad planning (i.e. not anticipating what needed to be done), bad execution (not doing it), or something else?**
I do think I suffered from a little bit of bad planning, as well as some bad execution (I had unanticipated company this weekend, so I didn't get as much done as I would have liked. In terms of bad planning, I didn't really take into account the benefits of choosing certain functionalities from a user perspective. For example, I ended up electing to ditch lives all together and allow for users to skip levels intentionally. This allows users with impaired motor skills to get past level 2, and allows anyone to skip to a level theu think is most fun and/or challenging.

**Explicitly state what you’re working on next and what you intend to accomplish before you turn in your project.**
I anticipate the hardest parts of my code being the if statements that test the location of the character and fixing the laser turtle class, so I plan to work on them next and get them working (or request help!) before I do anything else.

# Here is my code.
I'm a little embarassed because I didn't make a snapshot trinket from the last Milestones post, so the code appears the same here as it does there. I will make sure not to make this mistake again for my final submission.
