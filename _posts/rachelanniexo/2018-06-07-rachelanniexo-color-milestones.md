[] Different screens/some with preset color pairings (EX: a chalk set that is made of a gray background and pastel color pairings)
[] For loop that sets up buttons
[] Allow users to import images as well?

[] **Modes (most will be set as functions)**
[] Make a mode that erases
[] Make modes that allow change of color
[] Including randomized colors
[] And random with user input
[] Make modes that allow change of shapes
