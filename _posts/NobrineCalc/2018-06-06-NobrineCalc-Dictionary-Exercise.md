Following along I had some trouble with my program due to not changing the location of what file should be read. After solving this I ran into problems with my syntax in using the incorrect slash button for the new table formation. This however did not stop my failure in not being able to print the float values. This turned out to result from an repeated line that reset my dictionary. This resulting error shows me that I need to review each line of code to follow the flowing function in order to recognize what parts of my code can detract the operations from achieving the goal.
