title: Refactor of Logic Turtle
---
Looking over my code and the results it gives out, I feel my work is too basic. I need to experiment with more options and try to output more results and think out of the box. This project made me realize I need to work on diversifying my code and working away from examples as well. 
This refactor of my logic turtle was simple enough as I changed the structure to have the production of the shapes gathered together to make a single function. My thought process while writing the code to simplify it was to take the two functions I utilized, the loop and repositioning of the turtle and place them in functions where the flow of the code could be simply followed and allow space for the storing of variables to be seen clearly.

In the future I will try to create more complex shapes and have the functions chain together to produce more variety. Maybe I can accomplish this by taking advantage of the ability to create functions and utilizing it to create a larger program that can easily be looked over to find flaws in construction. Overall I still feel my direction and imagination is lacking compared to other projects. Perhaps some time seeing different programs can inspire a spark in me as well.
