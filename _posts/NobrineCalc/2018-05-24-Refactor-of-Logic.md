title: Refactor of Logic Turtle
---
Looking over my code and the results it gives out, I feel my work is too basic. I need to experiment with more options and try to output more results and think out of the box. This project made me realize I need to work on diversifying my code and working away from examples as well. 
This refactor of my logic turtle was simple enough as I changed the structure to have the production of the shapes gathered together to make a single function.

In the future I will try to create more complex shapes and have the functions chain together to produce more variety.
