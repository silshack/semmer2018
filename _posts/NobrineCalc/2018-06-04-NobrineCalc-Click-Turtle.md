I enjoyed working on this. The ideas of what to add to this code to distinguish it eluded me for a while. I did mess around with the code and found with two turtles the keyboard command wouldn't send to both turtles. As a result I ended up focusing on use of only the mouse. I felt like the idea of what I could add was lacking, perhaps more designs can be added in the future.
