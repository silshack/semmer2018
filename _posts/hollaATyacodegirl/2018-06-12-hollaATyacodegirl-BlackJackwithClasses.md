I am having great difficulty understanding and implementing the data structure, classes. Below, I tried to create a custom class called 
Card_Deck, that initially has the module deal(). I defined cards as an instance of the class Card_Deck, and then tried to have the function
intial_deal() use cards.deal() twice, on line 25. Unfortunately, I am not having success, because I don't understand how to define Card_Deck.
I understand that __init__(): must be defined for a class. I wanted to put under the dunder init module that Card_Deck is a list of values
1-10 (for now), but I haven't been successful in this endeavor. I welcome any and all feedback on how to create a class for Card_Deck.
