I did my best to break down my simplified BlackJack project into do-able, separate milestones. The milestones still need some clarification, 
but this is a good starting point. 

06.05.2018- BlackJack App- Milestones

1.	Create a ‘deck of cards’: i.e. Generate a random number 1-10
1.	Deal ‘two cards’: 
Randomly generate to the user and dealer each, one hidden one shown 
1.	Compute sum for user and dealer, store… Dealer sum must be between 16-21 
1.	Ask the user whether they want to “HIT” or “STAY”
1.	If user returns “HIT”, add another randomly generated number to the user


USER:
*randomly generate two numbers
*randomly generate a number between 16 and 21
*compute sum, store and show	
*ask user whether they want to “HIT” or “STAY”	- 
*if user choses “HIT”, add another random number, update the total,
and check if total > 21	
*if > 21, automatically lose	
*if <= 21, continue to ask user whether to “HIT” or “STAY” until user inputs “STAY”	
DEALER:
*randomly generate a number between 16 and 21


-	return User’s sum	- return Dealer’s ‘sum’

COMPARE:
-	compare User’s sum separately, is it <21?
if not = BUST, User looses 
-	compare User’s sum and Dealer’s sum:
...

I need to put in more work on breaking down the comparison between the User's sum and the Dealer's number. Putting it on the to-do list!
