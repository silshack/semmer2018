look at other students' submissions until after you've completed your work.

**After your programs are done**, check other students' work and other resources online if you had questions.
Include a reflection about what you think you've learned and any concepts that are still fuzzy to you.
Did you encounter frustrating situations? Did you feel a lightbulb turn on?

Write a program that lets the user slam poetry.

Specifically, collect a series of text inputs by the user, until they type "done".

Use Python's Turtle to write these inputs on the screen, one under the other,
so that they're readable.

**Advanced**
The basic assignment leaves it up to the user to not put in too many lines or lines that are two long.  Can you increase the power of your program?

* Remember, there are 400 pixels of height in a Turtle Screen. What will you do if your user enters more lines of text than that?
* There are 400 pixels of width in a Turtle Screen.  What will you do if they enter lines of text that are longer than this?
