Submit a well-formatted pull request to our class blog with a reflection on your class experience so far.

Cover anything you think is relevant, but make sure to hit these topics:

* What's a lightbulb that has gone on for you? Give an example.
* Describe some confusion you've experienced.  Did it help you learn?
* What's still fuzzy for you?  What will you do to make sure you can resolve your fuzziness?
* What problem solving strategies have been working for you? Give an example.

Include at least **2** code examples from code you've written for this class.  Format your code in a multi-line markdown code block like this:

~~~~~
```python
# Three backticks starts a code block
# 'python' afterwards (with no space) makes the block syntax highlighted.
# Your code would go in place of all these comments.
# End the code block with three more backticks
```
